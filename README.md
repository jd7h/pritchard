Data mining on public security advisories.

### Etymology
This repository was named after [Francis Pritchard](http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Francis_Pritchard), the sassy head of Security from Deux Ex: Human Revolution.

### Idea
I want to find out whether we can successfully assign 
an impact score to a security advisory, 
based on the occurence of certain keywords in the document
and similarity to earlier advisories. 

### Planned functionality
* simple scraper
* crawling
* dataset
* keyword analysis
* frequency analysis
